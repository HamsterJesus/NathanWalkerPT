                    <p id="top-about-p">I am a Level 3 Personal trainer, and have spent 3 years studying at NESCOL, during this time I completed a Diploma in sport and exercise (Level 3)  and a HND in Fitness Health and Exercise as well as numerous CPD courses, that range from Autism awareness to an awareness in diabetes, this will help me to offer inclusive sessions and programs that are suitable for everyone. </p>
                    <p>To further broaden my knowledge around the positive effect that exercise can have on our mental health and wellbeing, I am studying a range of courses regarding mental health and the positive impact it can have on your health and exercise. </p>
                    <p>I am experienced in a variety of training methods that have helped me to improve my fitness and my health both physically and mentally. Competing around the UK in Judo has given me countless opportunities to train with and compete against top athletes, this came with plenty of time spent in the gym, being involved in countless training sessions. </p>
                    <p>I believe that health is hugely important to have a good quality lifestyle, this doesnâ€™t just include your physical health, it includes your mental health too. Having a healthy lifestyle can significantly help to improve your mental health as well as physically. </p>
                    <p id="bottom-about-p">I aim to use everything that I have learned to offer you specific training programs, nutritional advice and guidance in a relaxed and enjoyable manner to help put you in the best position possible to achieve your health and fitness goals. </p>
